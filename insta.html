<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>A survey was conducted by our team through which we identified seven key areas where users expressed their desire for additional or altered features on Instagram, which we can also refer to as their pain points. Prioritizing these needs posed a challenge for the team until we collectively brainstormed and came up with a solution to all user pain points.</p>
</div>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Our Solution:</h2>
        <p>Instagram Lux is a user-driven upgrade to Instagram. After analyzing data from 240 app users, we developed this upgrade to effectively address their pain points and meet their needs.</p>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
        <p>All types of Instagram users.</p>

<h1>Understanding the User</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>User Research:</h2>
        <p>We conducted user research through live interviews and surveys to gather data, which we subsequently utilized to create an affinity diagram. This allowed us to identify the most significant pain points experienced by current Instagram users. Additionally, we developed user personas to enhance our understanding and empathy towards Instagram users, enabling us to generate targeted solutions for their specific pain points.</p>

<h1>Starting the Design</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Ideation:</h2>
        <p>To initiate the ideation process, I began by creating paper wireframes to strategically map out the placement of the Instagram Lux upgrade within the existing Instagram interface. The objective was to enable users to easily discover the upgrade and, consequently, persuade them to consider purchasing a subscription.</p>

        <p class = "par">The paper wire-frames were transferred into Figma to create the initial digital wire-frames. These wire-frames served as the foundation for our low-fidelity prototypes, which I will later show your how they were used for user testing and iteration.</p>

<h1>Refining the Design</h1>

        <p class = "par">Once the low-fidelity prototypes were tested and validated, we took the insights gained from user feedback and made sure to address the suggestions that were received in the creation of high-fidelity mockups. These mockups were designed to provide a more polished and visually appealing representation of the user interface, showcasing the final look and feel of the product.</p>
