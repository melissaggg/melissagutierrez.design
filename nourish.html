<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>In California, 3,571,920 people face hunger day after day. Our goal is to reduce food waste and ensure that surplus food goes to those who need it. We also want to provide a simple and convenient way for volunteers to give back to their community.</p>
</div>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Our Solution:</h2>
        <p>Nourish is an app designed to connect people or businesses with leftover food to local food banks and pantries in Fresno, California. With Nourish, you can easily report food that you are going to dispose of and volunteers come pick it up and transport it to those in need.</p>
</div>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
        <p>
Donors:<br>Businesses/People with excess food.<br>Volunteers:<br>People wanting to give back or gain community service hours.<br>Consumers:<br>People in need of food.

<h1>Understanding the User</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>User Research:</h2>
        <p>We conducted an in-depth analysis to gain insights into our users. We started by creating three user personas, representing individuals who would likely use our app. Additionally, we conducted market research to evaluate our competitors, identifying their strengths, weaknesses, and the quality of their applications. We carefully reviewed this information and used it to generate ideas on how our app could effectively address the unique needs of our three different user personas. This research phase was crucial in shaping our understanding of our users and informing our design decisions moving forward.</p>

<h1>Starting the Design</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Ideation (Donor):</h2>
        <p>Initially, we brainstormed and outlined the user flow for three potential users. One of them was a store owner who wanted to donate food to a local food pantry after receiving a notification that the item was nearing its expiration date. We then created a paper wire-frame to visually represent this user flow. The wire-frame depicted the steps and interactions that the store owner would take within the app to report the item and initiate the donation process. This paper wire-frame served as a rough sketch to capture our initial design ideas and set the foundation for further development in our design process.</p>
</div>

<!--Picture-->
<img class = "fullimg" src="images/nour-paper.png">

        <p class = "par">We took the paper wire-frames that each of us created and transferred them into Figma to create our initial digital wire-frames. These wire-frames served as the foundation for our low-fidelity prototypes, which I will later show your how we used them for user testing and iteration. Figma allowed us to collaborate in real-time and create more polished and refined digital designs. We made use its features, such as reusable components and interactive elements, to create a more interactive and realistic representation of our design.</p>
