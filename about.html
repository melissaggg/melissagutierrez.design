        <p>My name is Melissa Gutierrez, and I'm a California-based UX designer and professional photographer with a love for fashion and music. I also love to travel and am always eager to see and learn new things, although my heart will always belong to Guadalajara, Mexico, where my family resides.</p>
        <p class = "bottom">As a UX designer, my goal is to create apps that are not only visually appealing but also accessible to all, especially those with unique needs. I obtained my Google UX certification during my senior year of high school at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) in Clovis, where I also studied graphic design during my junior year.</p>
        <p>I'm always hungry for knowledge, and that's why I'm thrilled to pursue a degree in computer science next year. Currently, I'm teaching myself web development and even built the website you're currently exploring. It's been a labor of love, and I hope it showcases the passion and dedication I put into every project.</p>
