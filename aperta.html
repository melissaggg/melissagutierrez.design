<h1>Project Overview</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>The intended user typically spends around 2 to 5 hours packing their equipment for various photography jobs they need to attend. On top of that, they invest additional hours in shopping for materials to restock their inventory. These tasks eat into their available time, preventing them from engaging in other activities. Moreover, packing becomes a source of stress when they have to keep track of everything that needs to be packed solely in their mind. Without a checklist, it's easy for the user to forget to pack certain items or even leave them behind at the job site.</p>
</div>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Our Solution:</h2>
        <p>To provide the user with a stress-free and organized experience when packing and preparing equipment for a photo job, and to cut down on the time spent on this task and shopping for materials, allowing the user to dedicate more time to other activities.</p>
</div>

<h1>Understanding the User</h1>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>User Research:</h2>
        <p>I conducted research through interviews with the targeted users. I observed all they said, thought, did, and felt and utilized the information provided to create an empathy map that helped determine the user's pain points. I then used their pain points to develop personas that had the same problems as my interviewees. Because I consider myself the type of person this app and interview were for, I had some assumptions about the interview responses. These assumptions were correct, as the interviewees said they felt stressed and overwhelmed when packing equipment and would like to reduce the time spend completing this task.</p>

<h1>Starting the Design</h1>

        <p>To start off the design process, I began sketching down ideas, on pen and paper, for pages of our interface in which we could include every one of the app's intended features while also incorporating solutions to our user pain points.</p>

        <h2>What We Learned:</h2>
        <p>While creating the first user flow of the app, Apertura, I learned that although attention to detail is an incredible skill to have, I have to remember to manage my time more wisely. I tend to spend too much time on the simplest details that probably don’t deserve that attention.</p>
</div>

<div class = "break">
        <h2>Impact:</h2>
        <p>Apertura is an app that could truly help photographers manage their time better and help them feel more stress free while preparing for the job.<br><br>A quote from our usability study:<br>
                “I love the way I can compare prices from different stores on this item. That will for sure come in handy, and after I can just press complete order!”</p>
